## Notes

- The wishlist is **session-only** — it resets when the browser tab is closed. No backend or localStorage is used for wishlist data.
- Authentication is **mocked** — no real backend exists. Login/signup creates a temporary in-memory user stored in localStorage.
- All product images are sourced from Pinterest and Unsplash for demonstration purposes.
- The site is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
